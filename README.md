## Book_Searching
This app was created using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database and Node.js/Express.js server and API.<br>
I completed this application by setting up Apollo Servedr to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.<br>
I also modified the exisiting middleware so that it will work in the context of a GraphQL API.<br>

## Installation
-npm install apollo-server-express@2.15.0<br>
