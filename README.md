## Book_Searching
This app was created using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database and Node.js/Express.js server and API. I completed this application by setting up Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. I also modified the exisiting middleware so that it will work in the context of a GraphQL API.

Book Searching allows you to search any book you would like, and save the book with the books information to your account.<br>
Each book will have a small description with what the book is about and if there are movies based on the book.
